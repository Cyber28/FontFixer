# Font Fixer

This mod replaces the CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) fonts with dynamic ones.

## Why do I need this mod?

The fonts in the game only include characters which are used by the game. If a mod wants to use a character that isn't already used in the game, it will display as an empty square.

## The fonts look a bit different, why is that?

I couldn't figure out the exact settings for the original fonts, but these should be a bit more readable for more complicated characters.

## Installation (manual)

You need the [pre-configured BepInEx pack](https://stacklands.thunderstore.io/package/BepInEx/BepInExPack_Stacklands) for this mod. If you installed BepInEx from a different place, you may need to edit the config files.

Extract the contents of this folder to `Stacklands/BepInEx/plugins/FontFixer`. The final folder layout should look like this:
```
plugins/
  FontFixer/
    FontFixer.dll
    mod.bundle
    icon.png
    manifest.json
    README.md
```

# Fonts used:
