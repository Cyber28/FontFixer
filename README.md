# Font Fixer

This mod replaces the CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) fonts with dynamic ones.

# Why do I need this mod?

The fonts in the game only include characters which are used by the game. If a mod wants to use a character that isn't already used in the game, it will display as an empty square.

# The fonts look a bit different, why is that?

I couldn't figure out the exact settings for the original fonts, but these should be a bit more readable for more complicated characters.

# Fonts used:

[Noto Sans](https://fonts.google.com/noto/fonts)
